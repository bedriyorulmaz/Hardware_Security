# Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs)

This project focuses on the design, implementation, and evaluation of **Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs)**, leveraging SRAM-based PUF responses for secure hardware identification and authentication.

## Overview

### What are PUFs?

**Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs)** exploit the inherent variations in microchip manufacturing to generate unique and reproducible responses. These responses are used for secure hardware operations such as authentication, cryptographic key generation, and anti-counterfeiting.

A PUF operates using a **challenge-response mechanism**:
- **Challenge**: An input to the PUF system.
- **Response**: The unique output generated by the PUF, based on physical device characteristics.

### SRAM-Based PUF

In this project, the SRAM-based PUF leverages the unpredictable power-up state of SRAM cells. When the FPGA is powered on, each SRAM cell initializes to a `0` or `1` based on manufacturing variations. This behavior is unique for each chip and consistent for the same chip under normal conditions.

Key features of SRAM-based PUFs:
- **Uniqueness**: Differentiates devices.
- **Reliability**: Consistently reproduces responses under varying conditions.
- **Low Overhead**: Utilizes existing SRAM, minimizing additional hardware costs.

## Dataset

### 20 Text Files: FPGA Measurements

The dataset consists of 20 text files, each representing the state of SRAM cells during one power cycle:
- The FPGA was **powered on** to capture SRAM states and then **powered off** to reset.
- This process was repeated 20 times, resulting in 20 independent measurements.

#### File Details:
- Each file (e.g., `puf_data_1.txt`) contains hexadecimal values representing the SRAM state.
- Each line in the file corresponds to a PUF response from a single chip.

### Purpose:
- **Reliability**: Compare multiple power cycles of the same chip to measure consistency.
- **Uniqueness**: Compare responses from different chips.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Evaluate uniformity and bit-aliasing across responses.

## Metrics

### Evaluation Metrics

The project evaluates the PUF using these metrics:

1. **Uniqueness**:
   - Measures how distinct the PUF responses are across devices.
   - Achieved: **49.84%**.

2. **Reliability**:
   - Assesses the consistency of a PUF response under varying conditions.
   - Average Reliability: **95.94%**
     - Maximum Reliability: **Chip 178** (98.25%).
     - Minimum Reliability: **Chip 40** (93.46%).

3. **Uniformity**:
   - Checks the balance of `0`s and `1`s in the PUF response.
   - Achieved: **49.66%**.

4. **Bit-Aliasing**:
   - Analyzes biases in individual bits across devices.
   - Achieved: **49.66%**.

## Implementation

### How to Use

1. **Setup**:
   - Place the PUF data files (`puf_data_1.txt`, ..., `puf_data_20.txt`) in the `PUF` directory.

2. **Run Metrics Script**:
   - Use the provided Python script `puf_metrics.py` to calculate metrics:
     ```bash
     python3 puf_metrics.py
     ```

3. **Synthesis and Programming**:
   - Ensure your environment is correctly configured for **OSS CAD Suite**.
   - Run the following command to synthesize, place, and route the design:
     ```bash
     make
     ```
   - Program the FPGA with:
     ```bash
     make prog-flash
     ```

4. **Results**:
   - Metrics summary: `result/results.txt`
   - Reliability plot: `result/reliability_plot.png`

### Output Details

- **results.txt**: Summarizes all calculated metrics.
- **reliability_plot.png**: Visualizes reliability for each chip.

## Applications

PUFs have several practical applications in hardware security, including:
- **Device Authentication**: Ensuring secure and unique device identification.
- **Cryptographic Key Generation**: Generating unique keys without storing them.
- **Anti-Counterfeiting**: Verifying hardware authenticity.
- **Secure Boot**: Protecting firmware integrity during startup.
